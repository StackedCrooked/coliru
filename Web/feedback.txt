You should implement stdin somehow.
You've been doing a great job so far. I love using Coliru to send and receive samples. Keep up the great work! <3
Definitely needs more bananas.
Simple gcc error prettifier ala http://tinyurl.com/2fcpre6
That last feedback url is a rickroll.
Please fix the Clang installation :3 (Add libc++)
Wut!!!? You removed multiline commandline input the moment I showed you how it's awesome?... Sad. [sehe]
With the new feedback feature, Coliru is now 20% cooler!
Nothing (FIXED?)
Fuck data sanitation!
The position of the feeback button is intrusive; the right-bottom corner is an easy click target, I'd put the compile button there, and the share button next to that. (FIXED: The feedback is now in the header.)
Why not reinstate (PLEASE?) the multiline commandline box and put a 'post as feedback' next to /that/ so that if you click it, it will post the contents of the box as feedback? (FIXED: Shift-enter can be used for multiline commands.)
Can has focus back in edit window after hitting "compile"? :3 (FIXED: Focus will be restored when pressing the compile button. However, not that you can also use Ctrl-B to compile (Cmd-B on Mac)).
Can we get some kind of assembly output prettyfier?
Also, double-clicking on errors on the output window jumping to said line would be nice - ala visual studio (FIXED: Added as experimental feature.)
This is awesome.
Fix mobile view :(
When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right to the top left, off the top left corner, typed text will only go to the cursor until a click is made. (FIXED: The move-out event could not be detected because there was no margin between the editor and the browser window border. The introduction of the header fixes this.)
Links at the top "does not work" when opened in a new tab.
I say rename Q&A to FAQ and make it its own HTML page.
"Write" link doesn't work after you clicked and entered the "Read" link and then go back.
Make the feedback input-thingy wider.
I get a std::runtime_error when trying to use a std:::random_device, my guess is that is due to there being no /dev/urandom
Disable ctrl+s. It's a force of habit to do that every so often when I code, or do anything else, really. I doubt anyone actually saves this page. (FIXED: Ctrl-S/Command-S are now mapped to empty functor.)
A sort of continuation of "When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right": it still happens when not letting go of the mouse button until the cursor is off the webpage and up into the browser's area with the URL bar and everything (Chrome for reference)
Is it just me, or is " Help" is positioned a little bit off.
good

This might be a difficult one, but could you please add syntax highlighting in raw strings?

Cool site.
I keep losing my command line after hitting edit on someone else's link without thinking. Personally, I'd like it to not save their command line when I do that.

Please add an option (drop down list) to easily switch to and from gcc and clang. That is to aid new users.
It would be a great help if there was an option to display the original command line. set -x doesn't cut it in all cases, for example command chaining/piping info is lost. NOTE: you could use something like this: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/7494ff167fe27888 -- StackedCrooked

i agree with implementing stdin. Amazing service by the way
A W E S O M E
I don't know if anyone's said it, but the fact that you took the time to make something as awesome as Coliru is really nice. Judging from the repo, you did it all by yourself too, which is amazing! I'm very appreciate. Keep at it! U+2661 NOTE: Thanks! :) -- StackedCrooked

This is good!
The output doesn't show leading whitespace before the first printable character (test with `std::printf(" a\n b\n");`).
Leading whitespace issue, live example: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/659470535c00f7f4
About the leading whitespace issue: prepending "set -x" to the command line makes the output correct: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/429f9bc56a95625b

THIS IS AWESME THANK U
It is the infinite.
Supercool, but please add rustlang
This program trigger strange link errors, I don't know why: #include <boost/coroutine/all.hpp> int main(){} NOTE: you need to add -lboost_system at the end of your command line. example: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/2009e2927031ce3d -- StackedCrooked
If possible, could you install Boost.Phoenix and maybe some others? From dpkg -l I see you have filesystem,io,system, and a few more. NOTE: boost phoenix was already present, see http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/0db6ff4d83688f36 -- StackedCrooked
For those asking for stdin, if you expect a fixed input you can pipe it in or hardcode it, e.g. in C++ http://codepad.org/hQ5uHwM2
would it be possible to store editor default contents to a cookie or something like that? so that we have custom default to start with? NOTE: you can click the "restore editor" link in the toolbar? -- StackedCrooked

how long will the shared files stay in the archive? NOTE: As long as Coliru stays alive. You can make your own backup by checking out the svn repo: http://coliru.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Archive2/ -- StackedCrooked
I should donate someday. :) NOTE: No need to feel bad if you don't :) -- StackedCrooked
clang with libc++ works if you add "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6" to the command line (eg: clang++ -stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -pthread main.cpp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6)
A quick thank you for this online compiler I've used for a while now. :)
This is a wonderful tool! But what protections do you have in place so that I don't write code like: "while (1) { fork(); }"? NOTE: Combination of Linux user permissions, ulimit, iptables, setsid/pgid, timeout, chroot and a few other small measures. -- StackedCrooked

Hi, have problem with the letter length. Using Safari on Mac OS X and as more letters i write as farther away from the letters e.g. | = cursor example: [ std::string | ], [std::cout << "Hello World"     | ] -- and i cannot figure out where i am anymore when between two letters.
how can get complied code ? where we can download it?

Just a BIG thing: I rebooted your server. Way too easy : I just ran 'ps', saw 'ruby','sandbox.sh', kill'd them, then 'shutdown'. Way too easy. BTW, i'm sorry if I bother'd you, this was just for showing you how easy it was to haxx your server. Sorry. NOTE: Thanks for lettting me know. The user code is run with the same uid as the webserver. This means you have the ability to kill all processes from that uid, including the ruby webserver itself. (The webserver will then restart a few seconds later.) Your hack was recently made possible because I decided to allow access to /proc. Access to /proc enables users to run tools like valgrind. Unfortunately, this now turns out to be a bad thing. So I removed /proc access. -- StackedCrooked
Guys really, dont let anybody execute commands different from gcc...the shell let any user to execute any command...plis fix that vulnerability!!!!!! NOTE: I realize that providing full command-line access enables more potential ways for abuse. However, this is the functionality that I want to provide with Coliru. -- StackedCrooked
STL assorted
Please, disallow user 2000 changing archive files, using commands, i can change anything from archive, according to permissions. NOTE: The Archive is mounted as a read-only file system. (I just verified this by trying to write to archive from Coliru.) Maybe I'm overlooking something. Can you provide some more details on how you did it? -- StackedCrooked
Do you plan on opensourcing this? NOTE: It's on http://coliru.googlecode.com  -- StackedCrooked
About changing archive files. I just tried it, and it does say it's readonly FS and doesn't edit the file, so it's actually good. But strangely this command: id && ls -l /Archive2/00/031fc236163e42, says that I'm user 2001 and I can write to main.cpp, but I can't really do this though. Thank you! :)
BTW, I think, it would be good to keep date and time of message in the guestbook. Thanks for making coliru :)
Awesome!
please also add clang-3.6 svn
Looks like libc++abi is missing, can you please add that?
How about supporting VC++
could you update libc++? The one on coliru seems to be missing C++14 stuff (like std::aligned_storage_t)

The interface needs serious work. The command window at the bottom needs to be expandible; many people use this for running large Python scripts and the inteface makes this incredibly cumbersome.

Hey! So, great tool, but, as many other I read in the feedback section, I'm a little concerned about security (from your point of you). Maybe this is the lamest and most useless thing you'll ever read in your life since you already use it, but have you considered running critical parts of the service in a container like a Docker container Atomic image? Awesome service and have a good day!

#include <iostream>

FYI: To try <experimental/filesystem> when using -std=c++14 you must add -lstdc++fs to the compile command (OK so far - works with g++ and clang++); with -std=c++17 "filesystem" support is not any longer "experimental" BUT the standard header <filesystem> is not found! Note that this affects a number of examples on cppreference.com
Really impressive that cpp-ref uses this!

awesome tool, great software engineering skills at display !
nice job, but very dangerous to provide a shell
The default C++ code presented in the editor is missing a return value from main().
#include <iostream> int main() { int num = 0; std::cin >> num; std::cout << "START @ " << num << std::endl; while(num != 42) { std::cout << "INC @ " << ++num << std::endl; } return 0; }

Unfortunately, impossible to measure execution time due to 1) some sort of caching  (it just prints already cached result if source doesn't changes), 2) inequal conditions from time to time (i guess, every time program runs on different server's with different CPUs?)
Please install modern version of C++ compiler, like gcc 8.2 and clang >= 6.
Also I will glad to see possibility to prepare input data in separate test file (which might be opened and read in program).

For some reason, clang doesn't provide access to certain members of the C++17 library, even when passed "-std=c++17".  The ones I've noticed are std::size, and header <string_view>.  See https://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/32ba82de8a5d42c8 for an example, comparing GCC to Clang.

what is share button for
"Share!" button takes what you see on your Coliru editor--modified by you or not--and makes it available as a new random link. Share that link and others will see what you made.
^ for example, I entered my code and Coliru made a link just for my work: https://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/945b4579b572e50e

Please make shorter URIs when sharing source. The problem is that today on corporate laptops clipboard is frequently disabled, so only way to copy URL is type it again. So it's better to have shorter URLs.
Very useful website. Thank you!

Hello from GCC 11.1.0 !
How can I create another file?
Hi there! Nice idea but are you sure it's secure enough for your server? Anyone can run whatever C/C++ code AND shell commands they want... How long will it be until someone finds a malitious use for that -- like sending spam... or worse?
I'm trying to use the API but I just get "765: unexpected token at...". This might be a stupid question but please heeelp...
Very Nice my guy

C++ From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
C=C+1 (IPA: /siː ˈiːkwəls siː pləs wan/) is a programming language derived from C by programming language algebra. It is one of the most successful practical jokes ever played on nerds who take seriously ideas like object oriented programming. It was also a pioneer of the technique of catching people off guard by introducing new features every five years or so that are too hard for the compilers to get right first time, and that, even when they do get it right, are incompatible with the old language in surprising and unpredictable ways. Every Gopher knows that Bjarne Stringsoup complicates the C++ spec every three years in order to sell more books to unsuspecting programmers.
