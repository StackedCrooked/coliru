main.cpp:1:15:
    The function `putStrLn' is applied to three arguments,
    but its type `String -> IO ()' has only one
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: putStrLn "Fuck" putStrLn "Hello"
    In the expression: do { putStrLn "Fuck" putStrLn "Hello" }
    In an equation for `main':
        main = do { putStrLn "Fuck" putStrLn "Hello" }
