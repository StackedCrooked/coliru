#include <string>
#include <iostream>

// Problem seems to be the nested braces, g++ sees braces and says this isn't a scalar type
// so it doesn't try to implicitly construct a string from a const char*
// clang goes one level deeper, sees the const char*, invokes the string ctor, now has compatible type
#if 0
What does the standard say ?

8.5.1/2 : When an aggregate is initialized by an initializer list, as specified in 8.5.4,
          the elements of the initializer list are taken as initializers for the members of the aggregate,
          in increasing subscript or member order.
          Each member is copy-initialized from the corresponding initializer-clause.
          
It is explained that:

8.5/14 : (...) is called copy-initialization. [ Note: Copy-initialization may invoke a move (12.8). â€”end note ]
But I found no evidence in 12.8 that in your specific case a move would be required.

8.5.4/3 Otherwise, if T is a class type, constructors are considered.
        If T has an initializer-list constructor, the argument list consists of
        the initializer list as a single argument;
        otherwise, the argument list consists of the elements of the initializer list.
        The applicable constructors are enumerated and the best one is chosen through
        overload resolution (13.3).
