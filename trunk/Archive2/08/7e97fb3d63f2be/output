  b64      (Base64 Encode/Decode RFC1113)
  Usage:   b64 -option [-l<num>] [<FileIn> [<FileOut>]]
  Options: -e  encode to Base64
           -d  decode from Base64 -?
           -l  use to change line size (from 72 characters)
           -h  This help text.
           -?  This help text.
  Returns: 0 = success, 1 = Bad Syntax, 2 = File Open, 3 = File I/O
  Example: b64 -e binfile b64file     <- Encode to b64
           b64 -d b64file binfile     <- Decode from b64
           b64 -e -l40 infile outfile <- Line Length of 40
  Note:    Will act as a filter, but this should only be
           used on text files due to translations made by
           operating systems.
