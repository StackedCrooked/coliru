bash: -c: line 37: `Today we have shared with the world that we developed a new jailbreak for iOS 7.1.1 by releasing a picture of a jailbroken yellow iPhone 5c at iOS 7.1.1. This jailbreak is a completely reimplemented exploit for an iOS kernel vulnerability that is completely based on an exploitation technique we discuss in our trainings. The discussion of this technique (not this specific vulnerability) was added to our course in March and makes exploitation of this specific kernel bug 99.99% stable. We mainly developed this new exploit in the last days to test the technique in the real world.'
