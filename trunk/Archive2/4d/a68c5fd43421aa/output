Let's the game begin!
  Constuctor Id=1
Let's create a pointer to the lambda.
  Copy constructor Id=2
  Move constructor Id=3
  Destructor Id=2
Now let's print lambda execution result.
  Print called for object with id=3
The functor's id is 3
Destroying the lambda.
  Destructor Id=3
Terminating.
  Destructor Id=1
