Before adding to map:
	[abc, [Count: 123]; def, [Count: 456]; ghi, [Count: 789]; ]
After one call to:
	getCounter("jkl") = [Count: 0]:
	[abc, [Count: 123]; def, [Count: 456]; ghi, [Count: 789]; jkl, [Count: 0]; ]
After one call to:
	getCounter("abc") = [Count: 123]:
	[abc, [Count: 123]; def, [Count: 456]; ghi, [Count: 789]; jkl, [Count: 0]; ]
After one call to:
	getCounter("def", 123456789) = [Count: 456]:
	[abc, [Count: 123]; def, [Count: 456]; ghi, [Count: 789]; jkl, [Count: 0]; ]
After replacing value [Count: 456] from key "def" with value [Count: 579]:
	[abc, [Count: 123]; def, [Count: 579]; ghi, [Count: 789]; jkl, [Count: 0]; ]
After one call to:
	getCounter("xyz", 123456789) = [Count: 123456789]:
	[abc, [Count: 123]; def, [Count: 579]; ghi, [Count: 789]; jkl, [Count: 0]; xyz, [Count: 123456789]; ]
After one call to:
	getCounter("abc") = [Count: 123]:
	[abc, [Count: 123]; def, [Count: 579]; ghi, [Count: 789]; jkl, [Count: 0]; xyz, [Count: 123456789]; ]
After `operator += 9876543210` on [Count: 123] = [Count: 9876543333]:
	[abc, [Count: 9876543333]; def, [Count: 579]; ghi, [Count: 789]; jkl, [Count: 0]; xyz, [Count: 123456789]; ]
