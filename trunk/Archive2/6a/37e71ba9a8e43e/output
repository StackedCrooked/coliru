Dear Professor,

I was wondering if it would be at all possibleto get an extension of the due date for the first project.
I have been ardently working on the project, but I'm having difficulty believing that I will be able to complete a
polished version by the due date on Thursday. Thank you for your consideration

Sincerely,
Ian McGaunn
