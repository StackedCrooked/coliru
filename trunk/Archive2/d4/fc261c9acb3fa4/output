The Gettysburg Address Fourscore and
seven years ago our fathers brought
forth on this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty, and dedicated to
the proposition that all men are created
equal. Now we are engaged in a great
civil war, testing whether that nation,
or any nation so conceived and so
dedicated, can long endure. We are met
on a great battlefield of that war. We
have come to dedicate a portion of that
field as a final resting-place for those
who here gave their lives that the
nation might live.
