 Yup.  There's the bug, you only count to `i`.  When checking `21`, `i` is only `6`, so you're not finding the `7` nor the `21` divisors.  The simple fix is to iterate all the way to `num`.

 An additional thing to notice is that the number of divisors doesn't climb evenly.  What if there is a number with 501 divisors, but there isn't any with 500 divisors?  In that case 
                                                                   ^

 Your code is an infinite loop.  If `div` never hits 500 _exactly_, then your code just calculates forever.  I don't think this is causing your problem, but it _is_ a bug.
