main.cpp:11:41:
    No instance for (IsChar [Char])
      arising from a use of `printf'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (IsChar [Char])
    In the expression:
      printf
        "%s %s %d\
        \ %s"
        title
        cast
        year
        fan
    In an equation for `filmToString':
        filmToString (title, cast, year, fan)
          = printf
              "%s %s %d\
              \ %s"
              title
              cast
              year
              fan

main.cpp:14:38:
    No instance for (Num Cast)
      arising from the literal `1992'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num Cast)
    In the expression: 1992
    In the first argument of `filmToString', namely
      `("A", 1992, [], [])'
    In the second argument of `($)', namely
      `filmToString ("A", 1992, [], [])'

main.cpp:14:44:
    Couldn't match expected type `Year' with actual type `[a0]'
    In the expression: []
    In the first argument of `filmToString', namely
      `("A", 1992, [], [])'
    In the second argument of `($)', namely
      `filmToString ("A", 1992, [], [])'
