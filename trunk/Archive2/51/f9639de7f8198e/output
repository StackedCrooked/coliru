1.    Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
2.    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
3.    To the last syllable of recorded time;
4.    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
5.    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
6.    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
7.    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
8.    And then is heard no more. It is a tale
9.    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury
10.   Signifying nothing.
