Hello from planet Earth.
planet Earth.
Planet Earth? Why hello there.

before: I think YOU had one of those autocorrect problems sir.
after:  I think you had one of those autocorrect problems sir.

One life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company.
The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.
You're going to help us Mr. Anderson, whether you want to--or not.

To be conscious that you are ignorant is a great step to knowledge.
I think you had one of those autocorrect problems sir.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Mankind.
It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.
You're going to help us Mr. Anderson, whether you want to--or not.
