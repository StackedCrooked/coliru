main.cpp:13:9:
    Ambiguous type variable `t0' in the constraint:
      (SomeClass t0) arising from a use of `def'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: def
    In the expression: def {inside = Nothing}
    In an equation for `myDef': myDef = def {inside = Nothing}
