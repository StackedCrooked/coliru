this is a side effect while parsing
parse result: success
Streamed output:

Greeting is bye world!
Side effects are (done) and <<other>> vars are untouched
Empty <<>> macros are ok, as are stray '>>' pairs.
<<nested <<macros>> (bye?) work>>
The order of expansion (evaluation) is _eager_: 'We meet again' will expand to the same as 'We meet again'
Lastly you can do algorithmic stuff too: eyb in reverse!
You can escape <<hello>> (not expanded to 'bye')
Demonstrate how it <<avoids <<nesting>> macros>>.
