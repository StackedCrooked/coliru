main.cpp:12:15:
    Ambiguous type variable `a0' in the constraint:
      (Renderer a0) arising from a use of `RendererImpl'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: RendererImpl initial
    In an equation for `initial': initial = RendererImpl initial
    In the instance declaration for `Renderer RendererI'
