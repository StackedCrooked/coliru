this is a side effect while parsing
parse result: success
Streamed output:

Greeting is bye world!
Side effects are (done) and ${other} vars are untouched
Empty ${} macros are ok, as are stray '}' characters.
${nested ${macros} (bye?) work}
The order of expansion (evaluation) is _eager_: 'We meet again' will expand to the same as 'We meet again'
Lastly you can do algorithmic stuff too: eyb in reverse!
You can escape ${hello} (not expanded to 'bye')
Demonstrate how it ${avoids ${nesting} macros}.
