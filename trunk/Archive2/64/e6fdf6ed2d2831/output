main.cpp:13:13:
    Ambiguous type variable `s0' in the constraint:
      (HasSome s0) arising from a use of `has'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: has 1
    In an equation for `f': f = has 1
    In the expression:
      do { let f = has 1;
           print "ok" }
