Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art
more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do
shake the darling buds of May! And summer's lease
hath all too short a date. Sometime too hot the eye
of heaven shines. And often is his gold complexion dimm'd!
And every fair from fair sometime declines. By chance,
or nature's changing course untrimm'd.
