main.cpp:19:11:
    Could not deduce (Eq a) arising from the literal `0'
    from the context (Num a)
      bound by the instance declaration at main.cpp:18:10-27
    Possible fix: add (Eq a) to the context of the instance declaration
    In the pattern: 0
    In an equation for `yesNo': yesNo 0 = False
    In the instance declaration for `YesNo a'
