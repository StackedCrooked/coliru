Coliru is good and you should feel good.
A GOOD JOB.
Feedback!
I had sex with your mom.
Better than sex.

You should implement stdin somehow.
You've been doing a great job so far. I love using Coliru to send and receive samples. Keep up the great work! <3
Definitely needs more bananas.
Simple gcc error prettifier ala http://tinyurl.com/2fcpre6
That last feedback url is a rickroll.
Please fix the Clang installation :3 (Add libc++)
Wut!!!? You removed multiline commandline input the moment I showed you how it's awesome?... Sad. [sehe]
With the new feedback feature, Coliru is now 20% cooler!
Nothing (FIXED?)
Fuck data sanitation!
The position of the feeback button is intrusive; the right-bottom corner is an easy click target, I'd put the compile button there, and the share button next to that. (FIXED: The feedback is now in the header.)
Why not reinstate (PLEASE?) the multiline commandline box and put a 'post as feedback' next to /that/ so that if you click it, it will post the contents of the box as feedback? (FIXED: Shift-enter can be used for multiline commands.)
Can has focus back in edit window after hitting "compile"? :3 (FIXED: Focus will be restored when pressing the compile button. However, not that you can also use Ctrl-B to compile (Cmd-B on Mac)).
Can we get some kind of assembly output prettyfier?
Also, double-clicking on errors on the output window jumping to said line would be nice - ala visual studio (FIXED: Added as experimental feature.)
This is awesome.
Fix mobile view :(
When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right to the top left, off the top left corner, typed text will only go to the cursor until a click is made. (FIXED: The move-out event could not be detected because there was no margin between the editor and the browser window border. The introduction of the header fixes this.)
Links at the top "does not work" when opened in a new tab.
I say rename Q&A to FAQ and make it its own HTML page.
