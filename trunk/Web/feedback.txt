Coliru is good and you should feel good.
A GOOD JOB.
Feedback!
I had sex with your mom.
Better than sex.

You should implement stdin somehow.
You've been doing a great job so far. I love using Coliru to send and receive samples. Keep up the great work! <3
Definitely needs more bananas.
Simple gcc error prettifier ala http://tinyurl.com/2fcpre6
That last feedback url is a rickroll.
Please fix the Clang installation :3 (Add libc++)
Wut!!!? You removed multiline commandline input the moment I showed you how it's awesome?... Sad. [sehe]
With the new feedback feature, Coliru is now 20% cooler!
Nothing (FIXED?)
Fuck data sanitation!
The position of the feeback button is intrusive; the right-bottom corner is an easy click target, I'd put the compile button there, and the share button next to that. (FIXED: The feedback is now in the header.)
Why not reinstate (PLEASE?) the multiline commandline box and put a 'post as feedback' next to /that/ so that if you click it, it will post the contents of the box as feedback? (FIXED: Shift-enter can be used for multiline commands.)
Can has focus back in edit window after hitting "compile"? :3 (FIXED: Focus will be restored when pressing the compile button. However, not that you can also use Ctrl-B to compile (Cmd-B on Mac)).
Can we get some kind of assembly output prettyfier?
Also, double-clicking on errors on the output window jumping to said line would be nice - ala visual studio (FIXED: Added as experimental feature.)
This is awesome.
Fix mobile view :(
When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right to the top left, off the top left corner, typed text will only go to the cursor until a click is made. (FIXED: The move-out event could not be detected because there was no margin between the editor and the browser window border. The introduction of the header fixes this.)
Links at the top "does not work" when opened in a new tab.
I say rename Q&A to FAQ and make it its own HTML page.
"Write" link doesn't work after you clicked and entered the "Read" link and then go back.
Make the feedback input-thingy wider.
I get a std::runtime_error when trying to use a std:::random_device, my guess is that is due to there being no /dev/urandom
Disable ctrl+s. It's a force of habit to do that every so often when I code, or do anything else, really. I doubt anyone actually saves this page. (FIXED: Ctrl-S/Command-S are now mapped to empty functor.)
A sort of continuation of "When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right": it still happens when not letting go of the mouse button until the cursor is off the webpage and up into the browser's area with the URL bar and everything (Chrome for reference)
Is it just me, or is " Help" is positioned a little bit off.
good
Turn on -pedantic by default.
This might be a difficult one, but could you please add syntax highlighting in raw strings?
It is that.
bitwise shift promo test

Could you please add virtual whitespace at the bottom? Please. :)
Nice work with "Restore defaults". But could you please add some whitespace between "Editor" and "Command"?
Any chance we could get a gcc-4.9 experimental?
still broken on Opera. Can't see/edit code... (seth)
It sucks on IE.
The error list always goes back to the top almsot instantly after scrolling down (Chrome).
My life is better after finding Coliru. Thanks
I can't write code with Internet Explorer 9 (but it works with Firefox 21)
what is what?
Hi from Nawaz. Good Job. ;-)
Does not work on an iPad
Not bad.
Doesn't work on Opera :(
Being pedantic. Could you please add highlighting for any files being #included?
Great job! Very useful. Does it work on mobile devices, cuz there is problem with editing the code on galaxy s3.

Wow this is great.
Really appreciate your work. Keep bringing online applications like this that help programming community.
Please include GCC's version somewhere in the page. Please. :-)
Error log keeps scrolling up to the top without user intervention
Cool site.
I keep losing my command line after hitting edit on someone else's link without thinking. Personally, I'd like it to not save their command line when I do that.
Could anybody give ref to c++0x standart?
I'd been looking for something exactly like this for a while. Thanks a lot.
The sample is bad(incomplete parameters for main, no return)
I'd like to use the API on a site I'm building for my students. Can you give more details about Error codes and such in the Q&A?
For some C/C++ coding on mobile devices, so good!
Great Website!I love the API!
If I can input something would be better!
You guys are awesome!
Goofy
wonderful site!
A gift from the heavens!
Um confusing question for feedback. ₱øwñ€đ.
好
very nice and helpful
Very handy tool. It'd be greate to enable libc++ for clang too. I tried trouble shooting it but couldn't figure out the error "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: could not read symbols: Invalid operation"
Raw text view as a temporary work around for not being able to select text on mobile (NOTE: this exists: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/mobile -- StackedCrooked)
I want a link to automatically switch to/from Clang and GCC. :)
Come from Shanghai
Nice man!
Its it.
It's damnit
I can't english under pressure
It's it!
Please add an option (drop down list) to easily switch to and from gcc and clang. That is to aid new users.
It would be a great help if there was an option to display the original command line. set -x doesn't cut it in all cases, for example command chaining/piping info is lost. (NOTE: you could use something like this: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/7494ff167fe27888 -- StackedCrooked)
I wish the Share page showed the original execution command! Love from Lightness
Please add FPC and Java :)
What's this function？
不知道这是什么原理，是通过网页调用g++编译器？还是只是模拟的？
vector of string/int with template, as in GoingNative2013 talk
OOOOOOOOO MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN! IT IS AWESOME!
i agree with implementing stdin. Amazing service by the way
A W E S O M E
I don't know if anyone's said it, but the fact that you took the time to make something as awesome as Coliru is really nice. Judging from the repo, you did it all by yourself too, which is amazing! I'm very appreciate. Keep at it! U+2661
Hello
Herro 
This is good!
The output doesn't show leading whitespace before the first printable character (test with `std::printf(" a\n b\n");`).
Leading whitespace issue, live example: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/659470535c00f7f4
About the leading whitespace issue: prepending "set -x" to the command line makes the output correct: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/429f9bc56a95625b

hange!!

THIS IS AWESME THANK U
It is the infinite.
yolooooooo
Supercool, but please add rustlang
This program trigger strange link errors, I don't know why: #include <boost/coroutine/all.hpp> int main(){}
