Coliru is good and you should feel good.
A GOOD JOB.
Feedback!
I had sex with your mom.

You should implement stdin somehow.
You've been doing a great job so far. I love using Coliru to send and receive samples. Keep up the great work! <3
Definitely needs more bananas.
Simple gcc error prettifier ala http://tinyurl.com/2fcpre6
That last feedback url is a rickroll.
Please fix the Clang installation :3 (Add libc++)
Wut!!!? You removed multiline commandline input the moment I showed you how it's awesome?... Sad. [sehe]
With the new feedback feature, Coliru is now 20% cooler!
Nothing (FIXED?)
Fuck data sanitation!
The position of the feeback button is intrusive; the right-bottom corner is an easy click target, I'd put the compile button there, and the share button next to that. (FIXED: The feedback is now in the header.)
Why not reinstate (PLEASE?) the multiline commandline box and put a 'post as feedback' next to /that/ so that if you click it, it will post the contents of the box as feedback? (FIXED: Shift-enter can be used for multiline commands.)
Can has focus back in edit window after hitting "compile"? :3 (FIXED: Focus will be restored when pressing the compile button. However, not that you can also use Ctrl-B to compile (Cmd-B on Mac)).
Can we get some kind of assembly output prettyfier?
Also, double-clicking on errors on the output window jumping to said line would be nice - ala visual studio (FIXED: Added as experimental feature.)
This is awesome.
Fix mobile view :(
When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right to the top left, off the top left corner, typed text will only go to the cursor until a click is made. (FIXED: The move-out event could not be detected because there was no margin between the editor and the browser window border. The introduction of the header fixes this.)
Links at the top "does not work" when opened in a new tab.
I say rename Q&A to FAQ and make it its own HTML page.
"Write" link doesn't work after you clicked and entered the "Read" link and then go back.
Make the feedback input-thingy wider.
I get a std::runtime_error when trying to use a std:::random_device, my guess is that is due to there being no /dev/urandom
Disable ctrl+s. It's a force of habit to do that every so often when I code, or do anything else, really. I doubt anyone actually saves this page. (FIXED: Ctrl-S/Command-S are now mapped to empty functor.)
A sort of continuation of "When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right": it still happens when not letting go of the mouse button until the cursor is off the webpage and up into the browser's area with the URL bar and everything (Chrome for reference)
Is it just me, or is " Help" is positioned a little bit off.
good
Turn on -pedantic by default.
This might be a difficult one, but could you please add syntax highlighting in raw strings?
It is that.

Could you please add virtual whitespace at the bottom? Please. :)
Nice work with "Restore defaults". But could you please add some whitespace between "Editor" and "Command"?
Any chance we could get a gcc-4.9 experimental?
still broken on Opera. Can't see/edit code... (seth)
It sucks on IE.
The error list always goes back to the top almsot instantly after scrolling down (Chrome).
My life is better after finding Coliru. Thanks
I can't write code with Internet Explorer 9 (but it works with Firefox 21)
what is what?
Hi from Nawaz. Good Job. ;-)
Does not work on an iPad
Not bad.
Doesn't work on Opera :(
Being pedantic. Could you please add highlighting for any files being #included?
Great job! Very useful. Does it work on mobile devices, cuz there is problem with editing the code on galaxy s3.

Wow this is great.
Really appreciate your work. Keep bringing online applications like this that help programming community.
Please include GCC's version somewhere in the page. Please. :-)
Error log keeps scrolling up to the top without user intervention
Cool site.
I keep losing my command line after hitting edit on someone else's link without thinking. Personally, I'd like it to not save their command line when I do that.
Could anybody give ref to c++0x standart?
I'd been looking for something exactly like this for a while. Thanks a lot.
The sample is bad(incomplete parameters for main, no return)
I'd like to use the API on a site I'm building for my students. Can you give more details about Error codes and such in the Q&A?
For some C/C++ coding on mobile devices, so good!
Great Website!I love the API!
If I can input something would be better!
You guys are awesome!
Goofy
wonderful site!
A gift from the heavens!
Um confusing question for feedback. ₱øwñ€đ.
好
very nice and helpful
Very handy tool. It'd be greate to enable libc++ for clang too. I tried trouble shooting it but couldn't figure out the error "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: could not read symbols: Invalid operation"
Raw text view as a temporary work around for not being able to select text on mobile NOTE: this exists: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/mobile -- StackedCrooked
I want a link to automatically switch to/from Clang and GCC. :)
Come from Shanghai
Nice man!
Its it.
It's damnit
I can't english under pressure
It's it!
Please add an option (drop down list) to easily switch to and from gcc and clang. That is to aid new users.
It would be a great help if there was an option to display the original command line. set -x doesn't cut it in all cases, for example command chaining/piping info is lost. NOTE: you could use something like this: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/7494ff167fe27888 -- StackedCrooked
I wish the Share page showed the original execution command! Love from Lightness
Please add FPC and Java :)
What's this function？
不知道这是什么原理，是通过网页调用g++编译器？还是只是模拟的？

OOOOOOOOO MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN! IT IS AWESOME!
i agree with implementing stdin. Amazing service by the way
A W E S O M E
I don't know if anyone's said it, but the fact that you took the time to make something as awesome as Coliru is really nice. Judging from the repo, you did it all by yourself too, which is amazing! I'm very appreciate. Keep at it! U+2661 NOTE: Thanks! :) -- StackedCrooked
Herro 
This is good!
The output doesn't show leading whitespace before the first printable character (test with `std::printf(" a\n b\n");`).
Leading whitespace issue, live example: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/659470535c00f7f4
About the leading whitespace issue: prepending "set -x" to the command line makes the output correct: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/429f9bc56a95625b

THIS IS AWESME THANK U
It is the infinite.
Supercool, but please add rustlang
This program trigger strange link errors, I don't know why: #include <boost/coroutine/all.hpp> int main(){} NOTE: you need to add -lboost_system at the end of your command line. example: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/2009e2927031ce3d -- StackedCrooked
If possible, could you install Boost.Phoenix and maybe some others? From dpkg -l I see you have filesystem,io,system, and a few more. NOTE: boost phoenix was already present, see http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/0db6ff4d83688f36 -- StackedCrooked
For those asking for stdin, if you expect a fixed input you can pipe it in or hardcode it, e.g. in C++ http://codepad.org/hQ5uHwM2
would it be possible to store editor default contents to a cookie or something like that? so that we have custom default to start with? NOTE: you can click the "restore editor" link in the toolbar? -- StackedCrooked

Lol at the idiot who thought to run js. Nice online compiler guys! NOTE: Thanks :) -- StackedCrooked
how long will the shared files stay in the archive? NOTE: As long as Coliru stays alive. You can make your own backup by checking out the svn repo: http://coliru.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Archive2/ -- StackedCrooked
I should donate someday. :) NOTE: No need to feel bad if you don't :) -- StackedCrooked
clang with libc++ works if you add "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6" to the command line (eg: clang++ -stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -pthread main.cpp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6)
A quick thank you for this online compiler I've used for a while now. :)
This is a wonderful tool! But what protections do you have in place so that I don't write code like: "while (1) { fork(); }"? NOTE: Combination of Linux user permissions, ulimit, iptables, setsid/pgid, timeout, chroot and a few other small measures. -- StackedCrooked
好东西
I used it when reading reference from cppreference site, it's useful for me. :)
YOU ARE AWESOME. I WISH THE BEST FOR YOU!!!
Excellent but will be better if we can choose other languages and compilers, GG
IT'S AWESOOOOOME!!!!
Hi, have problem with the letter length. Using Safari on Mac OS X and as more letters i write as farther away from the letters e.g. | = cursor example: [ std::string | ], [std::cout << "Hello World"     | ] -- and i cannot figure out where i am anymore when between two letters.
how can get complied code ? where we can download it?
System.out.println("Hello world");
been here :)
:(){ :|:& };: # I JUST HAVE A TRY IN THE COMMAND AREA
This is an awesome tool
Best online compiler on the web by far. Thanks to latest GCC & Clang compilers. Thanks!
please make the editor work with mobile devices. currently it is unusable. NOTE: you can use http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/mobile for a simple mobile editor. -- StackedCrooked
llvm c++abi now works well under linux, I suspect it's better to use it than libcxxrt
Good
Coliru is a great online compiler.
g++-4.9 is released! When will it be available in coliru??? We are addited to coliru now, so you need to add g++-4.9!! :)
Error: chroot: failed to run command `bash': No such file or directory
Thank you a lot!
oh that's what this box does - cool - good job!
this website is awesome!
Coliru is bloody awesome! :) NOTE: Thanks :) -- StackedCrooked

Are there any resources for creating a server side compiler? I'd love to set one up for grading student code in tutoring. NOTE: Not really. I had to do it all from scratch. -- StackedCrooked

watch out for sleep-trollers
I keep seeing "internal server error."  Any ideas? NOTE: I'm looking for the source of the problem. -- StackedCrooked

I'd like to use dmd/ldc/gdc 
"For those asking for stdin, if you expect a fixed input you can pipe it in or hardcode it, e.g. in C++ http://codepad.org/hQ5uHwM2" That is so much harder, you can't easily copy and past text, you'd have to make it compatible to c-strings which requires 2-3 more steps than jsut adding a stdin text edit to your website.
cannot compile in 32bit mode with -m32
Is there a keyboard shortcut for "Compile, link and run..."? -- Yes, Ctrl-B or Cmd-B
Anyone know how compilation code?
the site is unusable on my phone (chrome, android).  NOTE: there is also /mobile -- StackedCrooked

Boost.Flyweight and ASTs
Is there a way to open a coliru editor page with custom code printed on? I'm the cplusplus.com addon dev and i'd like to add coliru as a compilation option besides cpp.sh, but direct compilation could lead to too many compiler requests. NOTE: check out the API described in the Q&A document -- StackedCrooked
I'd prefer code to be shown before compilation... Should I not worry and compile anyways? NOTE: You can see the code in the editor before you click the compile button. I hope this helps. -- StackedCrooked
This is nice! NOTE: Thanks :) -- StackedCrooked
Can you install V8 (google js engine) - would be awesome to play with js jit c++ interop on here and use it for making scce for v8 irc. thanks! NOTE: Now now. -- StackedCrooked
how to compile using Microsoft C++ compilre NOTE: This a Linux machine and VS won't work on that. Sorry. -- StackedCrooked
Just a BIG thing: I rebooted your server. Way too easy : I just ran 'ps', saw 'ruby','sandbox.sh', kill'd them, then 'shutdown'. Way too easy. BTW, i'm sorry if I bother'd you, this was just for showing you how easy it was to haxx your server. Sorry. NOTE: Thanks for lettting me know. The user code is run with the same uid as the webserver. This means you have the ability to kill all processes from that uid, including the ruby webserver itself. (The webserver will then restart a few seconds later.) Your hack was recently made possible because I decided to allow access to /proc. Access to /proc enables users to run tools like valgrind. Unfortunately, this now turns out to be a bad thing. So I removed /proc access. -- StackedCrooked
Guys really, dont let anybody execute commands different from gcc...the shell let any user to execute any command...plis fix that vulnerability!!!!!! NOTE: I realize that providing full command-line access enables more potential ways for abuse. However, this is the functionality that I want to provide with Coliru. -- StackedCrooked
STL assorted
Please, disallow user 2000 changing archive files, using commands, i can change anything from archive, according to permissions. NOTE: The Archive is mounted as a read-only file system. (I just verified this by trying to write to archive from Coliru.) Maybe I'm overlooking something. Can you provide some more details on how you did it? -- StackedCrooked
Do you plan on opensourcing this? NOTE: It's on http://coliru.googlecode.com  -- StackedCrooked
About changing archive files. I just tried it, and it does say it's readonly FS and doesn't edit the file, so it's actually good. But strangely this command: id && ls -l /Archive2/00/031fc236163e42, says that I'm user 2001 and I can write to main.cpp, but I can't really do this though. Thank you! :)
BTW, I think, it would be good to keep date and time of message in the guestbook. Thanks for making coliru :)
Awesome!
please also add clang-3.6 svn
Looks like libc++abi is missing, can you please add that?
How about supporting VC++
could you update libc++? The one on coliru seems to be missing C++14 stuff (like std::aligned_storage_t)
er, nevermind the last feedback, libc++ is good, sorry
FF-ing awesome!!
