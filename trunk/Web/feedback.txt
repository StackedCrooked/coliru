Coliru is good and you should feel good.
A GOOD JOB.

I had sex with your mom.
Better than sex.

You should implement stdin somehow.
You've been doing a great job so far. I love using Coliru to send and receive samples. Keep up the great work! <3
Definitely needs more bananas.
Simple gcc error prettifier ala http://tinyurl.com/2fcpre6
That last feedback url is a rickroll.
Please fix the Clang installation :3 (Add libc++)
Wut!!!? You removed multiline commandline input the moment I showed you how it's awesome?... Sad. [sehe]
With the new feedback feature, Coliru is now 20% cooler!
Nothing
Fuck data sanitation!
The position of the feeback button is intrusive; the right-bottom corner is an easy click target, I'd put the compile button there, and the share button next to that.
Why not reinstate (PLEASE?) the multiline commandline box and put a 'post as feedback' next to /that/ so that if you click it, it will post the contents of the box as feedback?
Can has focus back in edit window after hitting "compile"? :3
Can we get some kind of assembly output prettyfier?
Also, double-clicking on errors on the output window jumping to said line would be nice - ala visual studio
This is awesome.
Fix mobile view :(
When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right to the top left, off the top left corner, typed text will only go to the cursor until a click is made.
Ok.
