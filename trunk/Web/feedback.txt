Coliru is good and you should feel good.
A GOOD JOB.
Feedback!
I had sex with your mom.
Better than sex.

You should implement stdin somehow.
You've been doing a great job so far. I love using Coliru to send and receive samples. Keep up the great work! <3
Definitely needs more bananas.
Simple gcc error prettifier ala http://tinyurl.com/2fcpre6
That last feedback url is a rickroll.
Please fix the Clang installation :3 (Add libc++)
Wut!!!? You removed multiline commandline input the moment I showed you how it's awesome?... Sad. [sehe]
With the new feedback feature, Coliru is now 20% cooler!
Nothing (FIXED?)
Fuck data sanitation!
The position of the feeback button is intrusive; the right-bottom corner is an easy click target, I'd put the compile button there, and the share button next to that. (FIXED: The feedback is now in the header.)
Why not reinstate (PLEASE?) the multiline commandline box and put a 'post as feedback' next to /that/ so that if you click it, it will post the contents of the box as feedback? (FIXED: Shift-enter can be used for multiline commands.)
Can has focus back in edit window after hitting "compile"? :3 (FIXED: Focus will be restored when pressing the compile button. However, not that you can also use Ctrl-B to compile (Cmd-B on Mac)).
Can we get some kind of assembly output prettyfier?
Also, double-clicking on errors on the output window jumping to said line would be nice - ala visual studio (FIXED: Added as experimental feature.)
This is awesome.
Fix mobile view :(
When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right to the top left, off the top left corner, typed text will only go to the cursor until a click is made. (FIXED: The move-out event could not be detected because there was no margin between the editor and the browser window border. The introduction of the header fixes this.)
Links at the top "does not work" when opened in a new tab.
I say rename Q&A to FAQ and make it its own HTML page.
"Write" link doesn't work after you clicked and entered the "Read" link and then go back.
Make the feedback input-thingy wider.
I get a std::runtime_error when trying to use a std:::random_device, my guess is that is due to there being no /dev/urandom
Disable ctrl+s. It's a force of habit to do that every so often when I code, or do anything else, really. I doubt anyone actually saves this page. (FIXED: Ctrl-S/Command-S are now mapped to empty functor.)
A sort of continuation of "When highlighting with the mouse from the bottom right": it still happens when not letting go of the mouse button until the cursor is off the webpage and up into the browser's area with the URL bar and everything (Chrome for reference)
Is it just me, or is " Help" is positioned a little bit off.
good
Turn on -pedantic by default.
This might be a difficult one, but could you please add syntax highlighting in raw strings?
It is that.

Could you please add virtual whitespace at the bottom? Please. :)
Nice work with "Restore defaults". But could you please add some whitespace between "Editor" and "Command"?
Any chance we could get a gcc-4.9 experimental?

which clang
still broken on Opera. Can't see/edit code... (seth)
It sucks on IE.
The error list always goes back to the top almsot instantly after scrolling down (Chrome).

My life is better after finding Coliru. Thanks
#include <iostream> #include <fstream>  #include <boost/scoped_ptr.hpp> #include <boost/exception/all.hpp>  struct my_error: virtual boost::exception, virtual std::exception { };  int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {   try   {     BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION(my_error());   }   catch(...)   {     std::cout <<"fail";   } }
