Does the number of virtual methods affect the object size?
sizeof Item1: 8
sizeof Item2: 8
sizeof Item3: 8
 => So Vtable is not laid out in the object. It's probably a pointer to array.

Does the number of base classes affect the object size?
sizeof Item12{}: 16
sizeof Item123{}: 24
sizeof Item1234{}: 32
=> It seems the VTable pointer of each inherited class is a "field" in the most derived object.

Let's see if we can iterate over the Vtable entries:
Index	VTABLE		Entry		*Entry
0	0x4012f0	0x400fb0	1
1	0x4012f0	0x400fc0	1
2	0x4012f0	0x400fd0	1
3	0x4012f0	0x400fe0	1
