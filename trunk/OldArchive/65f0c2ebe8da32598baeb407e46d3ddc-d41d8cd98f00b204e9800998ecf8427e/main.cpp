You are about to be provided with information to
start your own Google.

Some people posted comments and said this can not
be done because google has 1 million servers and we do not.

The truth is, google has those many servers for trolling
purposes (e.g. google +, google finance, youtube the bandwidth consuming
no-profit making web site, etc ).

all for trolling purposes.

if you wanted to start your own search engine...
you need to know few things.

1 : you need to know how beautiful mysql is.
2: you need to not listen to people that tell you to use a framework
with python, and simply use mod-wsgi.
3: you need to cache popular searches when your search engine is running.
3: you need to connect numbers to words. maybe even something like..
numbers to numbers to words.

in other words let's say in the past 24 hours people searched for
some phrases over and over again.. you cache those and assign numbers
to them, this way you are matching numbers with numbers in mysql.
not words with words.

in other words let's say google uses 1/2 their servers for trolling
and 1/2 for search engine.

we need technology and ideas so that you can run a search engine
on 1 or 2 dedicated servers that cost no more than $100/month each.

once you make money, you can begin buying more and more servers.
after you make lots of money.. you probably gonna turn into a troll
too like google inc.

because god is brutal.
god is void-state
it keeps singing you songs when you are sleeping and says
"nothing matters, there is simply no meaning"

but of course to start this search engine, you need a jump start.
if you notice google constantly links to other web sites with a
trackable way when people click on search results.

this means google knows which web sites are becoming popular
are popular, etc. they can see what is rising before it rises.
it's like being able to see the future.

the computer tells them " you better get in touch with this guy
before he becomes rich and becomes un-stopable "

sometimes they send cops onto people. etc.
AMAZON INC however..

will provide you with the top 1 million web sites in the world.
updated daily in a cvs file.
downloadable at alexa.com

simply click on 'top sites' and then you will see the downloadable
file on the right side.

everyday they update it. and it is being given away for free.
google would never do this.
amazon does this.

this list you can use to ensure you show the top sites first in your
search engine .

this makes your search engine look 'credible'

in other words as you start making money, you first display things
in a "Generic" way but at the same time not in a "questionable" way
by displaying them based on "rank"

of course amazon only gives you URLS of the web sites.
you need to grab the title and etc from the web sites.

the truth is, to get started you do not need everything from web sites.
a title and some tags is all you need.

simple.
basic.
functional
will get peoples attention.

i always ask questions on SO but most questions get deleted. here's
something that did not get deleted..

How do I ensure that re.findall() stops at the right place?

use python, skrew php, php is no good.
do not use python frameworks, it's all lies and b.s. use mod-wsgi
use memcache to cache the templates and thus no need for a template engine.

always look at russian dedicated servers, and so on.
do not put your trust in america.
it has all turned into a mafia.

google can file a report, fbi can send cops onto you, and next thing you know
they frame you as a criminal, thug, mentally ill, bipolar, peadophile, and so on.

all you can do is bleed to death behind bars.

do not give into the lies of AMERICA.
find russian dedicated servers.

i tried signing up with pw-service.com but i couldn't do it due to
restrictions with their russian payment systems and so on..

again, amazon's web site alexa.com provides you with downloadable
top 1 mil web sites in the form of a cvs file.

use it.

again, do not give into python programmers suggesting frameworks for python.
it's all b.s. use mod_wsgi with memcache.

again, american corporations can ruin you with lies and all you can do is
bleed to death behind bars

again, a basic search engine needs : url, title, tags, and popular searches
can be "cached" and words can be connected to "numbers" within the mysql.

mysql has capabilities to cache things as well.

cache once, cache twice, and you will not need 1 million servers in order to troll.

if you need some xdotool commands to deal with people calling you a troll
here it is;

xdotool key ctrl+c
xdotool key Tab Tab Tab Return
xdotool type '@'
xdotool key ctrl+v
xdotool type --clearmodifiers ', there can not be such thing as a `troll` unless compared to a stationary point, if you are complaining, you are not stationary. which means you are the one that is trolling.'
xdotool key Tab Return

create an application launcher on your gnome-panel, and then select the username in the comments section that called you a 'troll' and click the shortcut on the gnome-panel.

it will copy the selected username to the clipboard and then hit TAB TAB TAB RETURN

which opens the comment typing box. and then it will type @ + username + comma, and then the rest.

be smart, be like..
