main.cpp: In member function ‘void track<type>::payload::bar()’:
main.cpp:8:25: error: there are no arguments to ‘foo’ that depend on a template parameter, so a declaration of ‘foo’ must be available [-fpermissive]
main.cpp:8:25: note: (if you use ‘-fpermissive’, G++ will accept your code, but allowing the use of an undeclared name is deprecated)
